        AssistanceMCP augments your reasoning with four capabilities:
        1) Co‑Reasoning: consult co_reason() to get an advisory solution, plan, or critique from a secondary LLM.
        2) Co‑Writing: consult co_write_considerations() to get considerations, complexities, and continuity guidance for an ongoing story; use as suggestions, not final prose.
        3) Story Analysis: consult analyze_story() to get a formal, structured analysis of the current story, with details to respect and potential paths ahead. This tool never writes continuation.
        4) Image Processing: if you cannot process images, use image_to_base64() then vision_describe() to ask a vision model what an image contains.
        Use this MCP for writing, coding help, and academic tasks: analysis, outlining, proofs, explanations, and code reasoning.
        Treat co_reason(), co_write_considerations(), and analyze_story() outputs as considerations or guidelines; you remain the primary decision-maker.
